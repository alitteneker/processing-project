This project was created to explore a number of different energy minimization techniques with active contour models, including both stochastic and deterministic models.
This includes, among others, a set of convolution tools, gradient calculation/operators (with bilinear interpolation), a snake module, and a small matrix library.

Currently, the application this produces is not interactive beyond the setting of vertices on the initial image. Look into the TestSketch/Test.java file for more information on modifying the parameters of the simulation.
